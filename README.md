# SortingAlgorithmVisualizer
While being a TA for Introduction to Computer Science in Java, I found that a lot of my students had trouble understanding basic sorting algorithms. In an attempt to aid my students, while at the same time improving my functional programming skills, I decided to develop a sorting algorithm visualizer.

# Algorithms
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Quick Sort
* Merge Sort
* Heap Sort

# Run
* javac Sort.java
* javac SortingAlgorithmVisualizer.java
* java SortingAlgorithmVisualizer
